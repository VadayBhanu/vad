        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Discourse community refers to the group of like minded individuals  or an organization where one shares about their common goal, feelings and emotions with others. They have their own communication method and require members to demonstrate the knowledge and the engagement.To be the part of such communities one must use ethos(logic), logos(credibility) and pathos(emotion) to demonstrate expertise, reliability and passion.The aim of writing this paper is to share the details of my discourse community, programming and development. As a web developer, learning how to engage with my discourse community is a matter of professional growth and effectiveness in my contribution. I believe this paper will act as a stepping stone  in the journey of an individual  who wants to become a developer.

        <h2>Building the Foundation</h2>
        <p>The first thing I had to do was understand the technology and different computer languages to be a part of my community. Using logos, I have built a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing me to create interactive and visually appealing websites. I actively participated in different coding competitions, in order to sharpen my skills and polish my problem solving skills. When I first explored that I am interested in learning web development the first thing I did was searching what is web development and what is the road map to learn it on youtube. I went through several videos and took long courses of eight to ten hours. To strengthen my skills and showcase my projects, I created a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website not only serves as a platform to display my work but also demonstrates my understanding of responsive design and interactive web elements. Building this project helped me apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world context, giving me a deeper understanding of front-end development. I created user-friendly, visually appealing designs that users interact with directly on their screens. In contrast,I wrote the code for the backend that manages data, performs analysis, and handles all computational tasks behind the scenes. Although full-stack developers exist possessing skills in both frontend and backend development, effective solutions to real-world problems typically require collaboration between specialized individuals with complementary skills. My commitment to learning and sharing knowledge enhanced my credibility within the discourse community. By successfully building functional projects and participating in coding events, I demonstrated to others that I possess the technical expertise and creative mindset expected of a community member. My growing portfolio and consistent efforts to improve further validated my place in the web development discourse community.

        <h2>Establishing Credibility</h2>
        <p>By establishing credibility in the web development community, I appealed to their sense of ethos. As a website developer one must demonstrate expertise, commitment and professionalism. I have established my ethos by maintaining discipline and continuously watching the long video of more than eight hours working on the personal project tirelessly and making peer group projects. Fortunately, while watching a web development tutorial, my brother noticed what I was learning and interrupted to tell me that he shared the same interest. From that moment, we started learning together. We exchanged knowledge, revised the roadmap to focus on the most relevant skills for beginners, and decided to build a portfolio website as our first project. We began with basic HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to structure our website. Once we had a framework, we used CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to add colors, designs, and styles, spending about two weeks dedicating two hours each day to styling.Next, we wanted to make our website more interactive, so we started learning JavaScript during our summer vacation. By the end of our first project, we had completed the frontend development of our website. Honestly, we never expected that we could build such an interactive design. But after finishing the project, we felt incredibly motivated to continue learning and expanding our knowledge in this field Through this consistency and regular practice I was able to build the strongest foundation in frontend development.I started creating my friends on linkedin with the similar interest and started learning about the web development industry.Logically, web development is divided into two main areas: frontend and backend.By sharing my journey and projects on LinkedIn, I attracted attention from fellow developers who recognized my dedication and growth. Their feedback and connection requests further solidified my credibility as an active and knowledgeable member of the web development community.

        <h2>Emotional Connection</h2>
        <p>I appealed to their sense of pathos by highlighting challenges, emotional connections, and passion for web development.Becoming part of this community can be frustrating and challenging at first, especially since learning new programming languages feels overwhelming. However, it gradually becomes fascinating as things start to make sense. The sense of accomplishment that comes with building your first website is deeply rewarding. Slowly but surely, you begin to feel proud of your progress, motivated to push further, and inspired to create even more complex and interactive projects. My passion for coding stems from the joy of building interactive websites turned out to become my career building skill. It is an incredible experience for me. I also find common ground with other developers on an emotional level in the shared experiences, from surviving a frustrating debugging session or celebrating the launch of a successful project. This love for problem-solving and innovation is what motivates me to continue growing in web development. The excitement of overcoming coding challenges and seeing my projects come to life with every line of code is a constant source of motivation for me.  Debugging may be frustrating at times, but the satisfaction that follows when I finally solve an issue is unparalleled. It’s in those moments of problem-solving and creation that I realize how much I enjoy this process. Collaborating with peers, exchanging ideas, and celebrating shared achievements make this journey even more fulfilling and inspiring.

          <h2>Naysayers</h2>
          <p>My naysayer would argue that I am not a member of the discourse community because I don't have the enough certification that is essential for the web developer credibility. This could be the case because of my belief that self learning, practical learning and participation in the real world project is more valuable than that of just learning the theory and earning certificate  answering a few questions.Many successful web developer built their career with self learning and real world problem solving approach.The web development community values to skills and the best problem solving ability of an individual over the formal credentials.Some might argue that I am still a student and lack experiences to be consider as the complete member of web development discourse community.However, I believe that experience is the greatest teacher, and every project I complete brings me one step closer to mastering this craft. The beauty of web development lies in its openness and continuous evolution. There is always something new to learn and create. While I may still be a student, my dedication, hands-on experience, and passion for problem-solving speak louder than any certification. The journey of learning and growing within this community is what truly defines a developer, not just the credentials they hold.
